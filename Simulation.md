Simulation can be pegged into two categories

- Terminating Simulation
	- Interested in short-term behaviour
- Steady State Simulation
	- Interested in long-term behaviour

## Simulation Definations
`System State` A set of variables that contains enough information to describe the system
`Entities` can be permanent or temporary and can have various properties or attributes
A `list` is an ordered list of associated entities 
An event is a point in time at which the system state changes
