Heirarchical clustering is a technique that serves to precipitate statistical relationship within a universe of variables. It does this by top down divisive approach or a bottom up agglomerative one.

### Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

Here, the algorithm starts by labeling all variables as individual clusters. It then proceeds to identify clusters that are closest together to form a bigger cluster and the resulting cluster is treated similarly as the initial cluster. This happens repeatedly until one final cluster is formed, which comprises all the variables.
