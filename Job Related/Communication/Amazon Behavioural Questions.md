Leadership Principles Used
1. Frugality
2. Are Right, A lot

_S: I was handed over the Mutual Fund Analytics project, at the start of my career at Kaleidofin,  wherein I was tasked to implement a tool wherein by which fund selection process could be simplified. It was quite an ambiguious problem statement to start with. Prior to me taking up this project, there were some work done in moving window algorithm, however, the XIRR values weren't converged to actual values._

_T: So when I got ownership of this project there were few things that set out to acheive, one was to have an RDBMS wherein the dilema was to go with the existing database system that we already had, which was a OLTP system or to go with OLAP, which I learned by reseraching on database systems in a span of couple of days & locked onto the final decision_

_A: I finally went with OLAP system which required extra effort since I had to an develop my own database on the EC2 instance, though my first preference here was to go for AWS RDS, however upon realising higher costs involved in having RDS instance, I decided to go for the EC2 instance for frugality reasons_

_R: This project had a lot of work, infact at this point, it has got over 200 git commits wherein I would have commited over 150 of it. So I have cut short on lots of the details, which I am happy to elaborate if you wish to, however the major takeaway in the entire exercise was that because of OLAP system that I had as an foundation, we were able to execute complex queries such as windowing function , which would not have been possible otherwise with OLTP system, which is something I envisioned at the very start would be one of the benifits and I was right_

- When did you take a risk, make a mistake, or fail? How did you respond, and how did you grow from that experience?

Give story of the interview how you hired someone whose background story wowed you. And how you have been very careful ever since. Sonali Khakal

1. You are accountable and upfront instead of making excuses
2. They want to see that you can learn from your mistake and use the experience to get better
3. Stay on track with your answer and tell a clear and concise story
	
Leadership Principles
1. Bias for action

S: So I was working on developing dashboards for Customer XIRR [Explain XIRR], wherein I was asked to work on a new requirement to add new visuals to the dashboard pertaining to  Cohort Wise calculation, which was a personal request from the CFO & Solutions Head

T: My initial sense of the problem statement was that this is a straight-forward requirement, involving data-engineering wherein I would have to develop an additional DAG on Airflow, post which I develop the visual on the dashboard. I conveyed to the management that it would take roughly a week to materalise all the requirements end-to-end

A : I developed what I assumed what was requested by the mangement

R: However when the day came, it backfired since the solution head expected the calculations to be done in a certain manner & after quite a lot of back and forth dealing with the solution head and deep-diving into his excel sheet wherein his calculations were done, it took the original work roughly 2.5 weeks to complete. Hindsight 20/20 I should have been conservative in my estimates and should have taken all the details from the Solutions and raised my concerns at the early stage and not assume everything the way I thought of it, so as to ensure such cases do not repeat

- Describe a time you took the lead on a project

Leadership Principles 
1. Think Big
2. Insist on the Highest Standards

S: Mutual Fund Analytics Project is one of the most important project within my current startup which solved Customer XIRR, Fund Selection and Company Treasury Fund Selection process. However when I got this project, none of this was part of the project.

T: I worked on developing an OLAP database from scratch, designed the schema, handled DBA for this dataset. Mentored interns to take ownership of the data warehousing. Then developed dashboards for both customer level XIRR & company treasury fund & codified existing fund selection process into a standard procedure. Just to give you a context here, the data engineering codebase had over 7000 Lines of code, had over 301 commits, of which I alone did over 200+ code commits & worked actively to monitor the code commits of the my peers as well.

A: This project was very extensive and quite big considering the fact that when I started, I alone handled data warehousing development to dashboarding and  myraid of other tasks I would skip over just to keep our conversation brief

R : This project scaled up to have 3 more people under me, got bifurcated into 3 Major aspect Fund Selection & Company Treasury, Warehousing & Dashboarding and as a matter of fact this project has the highest commits in the data science team. Wherein I also put a lot of emphasis on highest code standards so that we have a strong foundation also this project was the first in DS team to incorporate Docker, so we could deploy our fund app on any instance [ Which is something I always was quite curious to put it to good use and I am quite glad I could deploy it within this project]

FundsIndia Churn Analysis

Deep Dive
Customer Centricity

T - Did a deep dive to see what is an important factor -Developed Logistic Regression Model to predict the churn aspect
