- Combining multiple features together into a new feature
- Encodes nonlinearity in the feature space, or encodes the same information in fewer features
- Creation of many different kinds of feature crosses can be done
- Feature crossing : synthetic feature encoding nonlinearity in feature space
- Feature Coding : transforming categorical to a continuous variable
