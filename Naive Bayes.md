### Bayes Theorem

Bayes theorem is centred around the defining formulae

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P({A\cap B})}{P(B)}$$ 

Here the probabilities are assumed to be dependent in nature.

`Dependent Event` : Here the probabilities can changes based on other events occuring
`Independent Event` : Here the probabilities are not affected due to other event occuring

### Derivation of Bayes Theorem

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P({A\cap B})}{P(B)}$$
$$P(B|A) = \frac{P({B\cap A})}{P(A)}$$ 
$$P({A\cap B})=P({B\cap A})=P(A|B)*P(B)=P(B|A)*P(A)$$
$$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)*P(A)}{P(B)}  [Bayes Formulae]$$
