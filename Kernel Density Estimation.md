Motivation : There will come a time when data will come across which doesn't follow any of the well known distribution, this is where KDE is quite useful.

KDE helps us plot the distribution of the random variables

Two things to consider are, 
1. Type of distribution to consider
2. Bandwidth - Will determine the smoothness of the curve
