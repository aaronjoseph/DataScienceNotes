- Get on the right foot - get the intro done right, gives great dividend
- Referral - If you know something about the person, mention something like this
	-> Hey John, nice to meet you Joe said so many nice things about you and I look forward to this
	-> Hey Casper, I was looking forward to talking to you, you have done a lot of great things, I've seen you have been with the company for quite a while for the company. I can't wait when I get a chance to ask you what's kept you here but I am really looking forward to that
	-> I liked your background, I noticed you joined recently, when we get a chance, I can't wait to ask you what drew you to the company and what suprised you about being here, really looking forward to this
- Ask them about their job function
	-> I really like your background I want to understand you became the chief information officer, I really want to learn more about your function because I have always been fascinated with that, so I would love to learn a little bit about that at some point throughout the interview
- When someone else comes in
	-> Hey Steve, great to meet you, just to get some context what department do you work on, what project do you work on?
