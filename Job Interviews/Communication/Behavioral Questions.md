If I feel I don’t have good opportunities here for X and Y, and if I’m at a point in Z where leaving won’t significantly hurt the product - for example right after a release - then I would want to compare that opportunity to what I can accomplish here. If there’s a huge difference between here and there, it would be bad for everyone if I didn’t move.Having said that, I would not be open to external opportunities except after a year or two year, and after achieving Z. If I can meet my goals here, it makes sense to stay.`
