## Types of Feedbacks

- Good feedback is always specific
	- "In this situation, this was my interpretation and therefore my conclusion is this"
- Generic Feeback
	- The more generic feedback it is, more hard it is to work on it
	- `Do ask for clarifying questions like :`
		- Can you give something more specific examples to work with
		- If the manager is unable to cite or can't give, then say `I am not aware of this happening. But if this happens the next time, would you be able to tell me the next time this happens.` Do check them with them later on
	
## 8 types of Biases

1. Recency Bias
	1. This is the most common bias
	2. The manager will depend on the latest memory, if you do an impactful task in the recent past or made a mistake in the latest period
	3. The manager will over-index on the latest information
2. Strictness Bias
	1. This could happen, when the manager is lot more tough on you than others
	2. There might be double standards here
	3. Some of the ways to make a better understanding is
		1. `Ask for specific feedback`
		2. `It is clear my bar for excellence and qualtiy is quite not where your bar is, I would like to learn from you` - here, get the goals and exceed them. Then schedule 1-on-1 and show the task that is being done. And show cases that you are taking their feedback more seriously
3. The Leniency Bias
	1. Hard to realise this issues, never challenge the manager on this
4. The Horns Bias
	1. For a major faliure -> It is extended to all major facets, wherein the review is pointed as low
	2. To counter this, ask them if you didn't make this major faluire, how would you rate the different areas based on performance. 
		1. `If they say, then I would rate you at Meets Expectations`, state that should you be rated badly due to this one-off incident. It may not be fair to rate all across, basis one bad performance
5. The Halo Bias
	1. Due to great work, you get rated very well. Therefore all areas of review get rated well `Stellar Review`
6. The Similarity Bias
	1. People rate similar people
7. The Central Tendency Bias
	1. Rating everyone in the team as equal, to prevent getting anyone into a disadvantage
	2. Get the strenght and weakness from the manager
		1. > If you had to choose one area I am strongest at, which one would it be. Do you think I am above expections ? Am I already there ?
		2. > If you have one thing I should grow and one thing I am not as good as the other, which one would it be
8. The Contrasting Bias
	1. Here, some high-performers are considered as benchmark
		1. To counter such issues, ask them for a given area of assessment what does someone look like for meeting expectations
			1. Then if the manager is stating certain points, mention something you do well
