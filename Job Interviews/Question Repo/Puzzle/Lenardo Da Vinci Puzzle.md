For a 10 digit number which is autobiographical in nature - wherein digits start from 0 to 9 (index starts at 0) and 0 position value indicates the no of times 0 occurs in the sequence as so on.

Answer Approach

- The sum of all the digits will be 10 for a 10 digit number
	- Likewise for n digit, it will follow the same pattern
- First digit representing 0 should be ideally greater than 3
	- Also, the larger numbers such as 6 and above should not occur more than once, as it will lead to sum of all digits to be greater than 10
- Considering $n_0$ > 3
- $n_1 = 2 n_2 = 1 (for 1)\ n_{greater than 5} =1$
- By above consideration to find which is the greater than 5 value, we take
- 10-(no of 1,2& x value) = 10 - 4 = 6 Is the value for 0th position
- That means there are 6 zeros

Final Value = 6 2 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0
