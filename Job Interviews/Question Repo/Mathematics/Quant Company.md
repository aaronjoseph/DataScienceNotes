Below is a list of asymptotic complexities of eight functions, each with input of length N:
A.      O(N^3)
B.      O(Log(N))
C.      O(Sqrt(N))
D.      O(N * log(N))

You need to forecast a number that will be drawn from a continuous uniform distribution between 0 and 60. You will be charged 4 dollars for every unit you overestimate (so if the number is 10 and you say 12, then you will be charged 2 * 4 = 8 dollars), and you will be charged 1 dollar for every unit you underestimate. If you forecast correctly, then you will not be charged at all. What number should you forecast to minimize your expected cost?
