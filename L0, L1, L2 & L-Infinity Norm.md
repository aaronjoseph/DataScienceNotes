`Norm` - Refers to total length of all vectors in a space

### L0 Norm

L0 Norm is not a norm. It refers to total number of non-zero elements in a vector space.

Consider (0,3), (0,0) -> L0 Norm is 1. Since there is only 1 non-zero element.

Consider the scenario of userid and password

UserID | Password | L0 Norm
---|---|---
Correct UserID | Correct PWD | 0
Correct UserID | Incorrect PWD | 1
Incorrect UserID | Incorrect PWD	| 2

### L1 Norm

Also referred to as `Manhattan Distance or Taxicab norm`. L1 norm is calculated as follows
$$||x||_1 = |x|+|y|$$

### L2 Norm

Commonly referred to as `Euclidean distance`. It is the shortest distance to go from one point to another
$$||x||^2 = |x|^2+|y|^2$$

### L-P Norm

Commonly referred to as `Euclidean distance`. It is the shortest distance to go from one point to another

$$||x||^P = |x|^P+|y|^P$$



### L-$\infty$ Norm

The **L<sub>âˆž</sub> norm**, also called the **maximum norm** or **uniform norm**, measures the largest absolute value among the components of a vector.

This norm represents the greatest magnitude among the vector's elements and is particularly useful in contexts where:

- The largest component dominates the system's behaviour.
- Uniform convergence is a focus of study.

Consider the vector [10,-11,20],
L$\infty$ will be 20.
