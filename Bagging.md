In bagging the fundamental idea is to combine the results of multiple models, however, the major issue here is the use of same set of data. Since the data used is the same, the resultant models will not prove to be useful.

Bagging uses `bootstrapping`. 

>`Bootstrapping` is a sampling technique in which we create subsets of observations from the original dataset, with replacement. 

The models are created on the the sample data. Final predication is outputted, after considering all the values of the minor models.
