The Law of Large Numbers stated that as the number of trails of a random process increases, the result's average would get closer to the expected values or theoretical values. 

The Law of Large Numbers is different than the Law of Average where it was used to express a belief that outcomes of a random event will "even out" within a small sample. This is what is known as "Gambler's Fallacy", where we expect the expected value would occur in a smaller sample.
