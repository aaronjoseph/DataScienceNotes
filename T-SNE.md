- T Distributed Stocastic Neighbour Embedding is an [[Unsupervised Learning|unsupervised learning algorithm]]
- T-SNE is used for data exploration and visualizing high dimensional data. T-SNE gives an intuition about how the data is arranged in a high-dimensional space
- The algorithm is non-Linear and adapts to the underlying data, performing different transformations on different regions

### Perplexity

Perplexity loosely says how to balance attention between local and global aspects of your data. The parameter is, in a sense, a guess about the number of close neighbors each point has.

### Steps followed

- Determine the "similarity" of all the points in the scatter plot
