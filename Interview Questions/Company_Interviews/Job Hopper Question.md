- They want to take safe decision
- They want to find the pattern - Is it negative or not ?

# Boiler-Plate Response
> You know what you are right, I have quite a few jobs in my job history and I discovered very recently that the reason I was that I was having so many was beacause of a common issue ,I didn't place stability of the company. That stability criterion is something I missed out. So I did self-reflection and what that also did for me, it put me in much better position to evaluate from a employers perspective whether of not this job oppurtunity in this company will be great for me or not basis the criteria .I wasn't very skilled to get that information from the employer & I am in a much better position now because I have gone through this self-reflection & I understand what I specifically need to evaluate it and how to evaluate it. Also, I am in a much better position to understand whether your company is good for me. Because when I look at the previous jobs I was looking for  the common thread was & I am in a much better postion to evaluate whether or not it is a good oppurtunity for me
