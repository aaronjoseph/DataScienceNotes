- Difference between Normalization and standardization
- Given a PDF for OCR, jot down a few issues and how to improve quality of OCR, name a few techniques and what impact will they have on the final output.
- Suppose 'name' field in a table consists of 5 million records, with few records having the names written without any delimiter, suggest ways in which we can deal with the issue and make it right.eg: - Ram Mohan Shukla is written as Rammohanshukla
