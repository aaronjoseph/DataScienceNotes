Skewed Datasets, or Imbalanced datasets are ones wherein the split between classes are not equal and one class in particular is very small.

For this [[Confusion Matrix & Metrics]] is the best way to approach it.

Metrics such as `Precision` and `Recall` can be used to understand the performance of the model.


## Right Skew

Right skew also known as positive skew, the distribution is longer on the right side of its peak than on it's left. 

## Left Skew

Left skew, also known as negative skew, the distribution is longer on the left side of it's peak.
