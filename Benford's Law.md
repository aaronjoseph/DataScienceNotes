Benford's Law is also called Newcomb-Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, of the first digit law. Is a mathematical law about the leading digit number in a real world dataset.

> Benford's law states that the leading digit is likely to be small in many naturally occurring collections of numbers

By accurate defination, 

Benford law states that a set of numbers is said to satisfy Benford's law if the leading digit d(d $\epsilon$  1,...,9) occurs within the equation

$$P(d) = log_{10}(d +1) - log_{10}(d) = log_{10}\frac{d+1}{d} = log_{10}(1 + \frac{1}{d})$$

d | P(d)
---|---
1 | 30.10%
2 | 17.60%
3 | 12.50%
4 | 9.70%
5 | 7.90%
6 | 6.70%
7 | 5.80%
8 | 5.10%
9 | 4.60%

This law is used for fraud detection on tax forms, election results, economic numbers and accounting figures.
