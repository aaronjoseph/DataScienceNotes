Metcalfe's Law was devised during the time when he was trying to sell network cards to other users. Now the law dictates the following

> While the cost of the network was directly proportional to the number of cards, the value of the network was proportional to the square of the number of users. Or in other words, `the value was due to the connectivity between users, enabling them to work together and achieve more than they could alone.`

## Metcalfe's Law in Internet Business

Network effects have become an essential component in understanding the sucess of internet/tech companies

1. The internet itself has become a facilitator for network effects. As it becomes less and less expensive to connect users on platforms, those able to attract them in mass become extremely valuable over time. 
2. Network effects facilitate scale. As digital businesses and platforms scale, they gain a competitive advantage, as they control more of a market.
3. Network effects create a competitive advantage - wherein due to scale, users are forced to stay in the network with the most number of users, hence `winner take all becomes the guiding principle in the internet market`
