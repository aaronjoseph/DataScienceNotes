**Week 1: Machine Learning Fundamentals**

**Day 1-2: Precision and Recall**
- **Study:**
  - Review definitions and differences between precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.
  - Understand how these metrics are used in classification problems.
  - Learn about the Precision-Recall trade-off and how to choose the right metric based on the problem context.
- **Practice:**
  - Implement precision, recall, and F1 score calculations in Python.
  - Work through examples using datasets like the Iris or Titanic dataset.
- **Resources:**

  - [Hands-On with Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html)

**Day 3-4: Hypothesis Testing**
- **Study:**
  - Review concepts of null hypothesis, alternative hypothesis, p-values, and significance levels.
  - Understand types of errors (Type I and Type II).
  - Learn about common tests: t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA.
- **Practice:**
  - Conduct hypothesis testing on sample data using Python (e.g., using `scipy.stats`).
- **Resources:**

**Day 5-7: A/B Testing**
- **Study:**
  - Understand the A/B testing framework: control group, treatment group, and metrics.
  - Learn how to design an A/B test, sample size determination, and interpreting results.
  - Study real-world applications and case studies.
- **Practice:**
  - Simulate an A/B test using synthetic data and analyze the results using Python.
- **Resources:**

**Week 2: PySpark and Advanced ML Concepts**

**Day 1-3: PySpark Models**
- **Study:**
  - Get familiar with Apache Spark and the PySpark API.
  - Learn about Spark's MLlib library for machine learning, including key algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and clustering.
  - Understand data handling and preprocessing in PySpark.
- **Practice:**
  - Implement a machine learning pipeline in PySpark from data ingestion to model training and evaluation.
  - Work on a PySpark project, such as building a classification or regression model on a large dataset.
- **Resources:**
  - [PySpark Documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html)
  - [Machine Learning with PySpark](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/machine-learning-with-pyspark)

**Day 4-7: Mock Interviews and Review**
- **Day 4-5: Review All Topics**
  - Revisit key concepts in precision, recall, hypothesis testing, A/B testing, and PySpark.
  - Ensure you can explain these concepts clearly and confidently.
- **Day 6: Mock Interviews**
  - Conduct mock interviews with a friend or use an online platform.
  - Focus on explaining your thought process and problem-solving approach.
  - Include coding practice, particularly for PySpark.
- **Day 7: Rest and Final Review**
  - Take a light day to review your notes, relax, and mentally prepare for the interview.
  - Go over any weak areas and ensure youâ€™re comfortable with common interview questions.

**Ongoing: Coding Practice and Behavioral Preparation**

**Coding Practice:**
- Regularly solve problems on platforms like LeetCode, focusing on algorithms, data structures, and machine learning problems.

**Behavioral Preparation:**
- Prepare for behavioural questions by reflecting on your past experiences and structuring your answers using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
