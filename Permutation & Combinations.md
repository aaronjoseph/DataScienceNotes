Permutation gives the number of times things can be ordered, taking n things r at a time. Use Permutation, when the order matters

$$nPr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$$
Combination is a step ahead of permutation, it divides out the duplicates. Use Combination, when the order doens't matter

$$nCr = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!(r)!}$$
