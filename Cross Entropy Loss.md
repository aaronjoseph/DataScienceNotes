**Cross-entropy loss** (also called log loss) is a widely used loss function in machine learning and deep learning for tasks involving classification.

**Formula**:

$$
L = - \sum_{i=1}^{V} y_i \log(p_i)
$$
- $y_i$ is the true distribution (usually one-hot encoded). 
- $p_i$ is the predicted probability for word $i$.

| **Binary Classification**           | Measures performance in tasks where the output is either 0 or 1.                                           | Spam detection, image classification (yes/no)                                                     |
| **Multiclass Classification**       | Used when there are more than two classes, and the output is a probability distribution across classes.    | Image classification (e.g., dog, cat, car), text classification (news categories)                 |
| **Multilabel Classification**       | Applies cross-entropy loss to each label independently in tasks where an instance can have multiple labels.| Image tagging (e.g., predicting multiple tags for an image), document classification               |
| **Deep Learning (Neural Networks)** | Standard loss function for neural networks, especially with softmax output layers.                        | CNNs (image classification), RNNs/Transformers (text generation, translation)                     |
| **Logistic Regression**             | Used in logistic regression for binary classification tasks.                                               | Predicting purchase likelihood, predicting medical conditions                                     |
| **NLP and Language Modeling**       | Measures the error in predicting the next word in language modeling or translation tasks.                  | Next-word prediction, machine translation, text generation                                        |
| **Recommender Systems**             | Used in collaborative filtering when the problem is framed as a classification task.                       | Predicting user-item interactions, product or movie recommendations                               |
| **Generative Models (GANs)**        | In GANs, the discriminator uses cross-entropy to classify real vs. generated data.                        | Image generation, deepfake generation                                                             |
| **Speech Recognition**              | Used in models that predict sequences of words from spoken audio.                                          | Converting speech to text, text-to-speech systems                                                 |


### **Why is Cross-Entropy Loss Used?**

- **Smooth Probability Outputs**: Cross-entropy loss is effective when the model produces probabilities. It penalizes low probabilities assigned to the correct class and high probabilities assigned to incorrect classes.
- **Differentiability**: Cross-entropy is a differentiable loss function, which is essential for training neural networks using gradient-based optimization techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
- **Probability Interpretation**: It works well with models that output probability distributions, such as softmax classifiers.
