Early Mark 1 compuer was a powerful compter, that couldnot be modified to make computation as todays modern computers can do. `Early Computers were early use` due to two reasons
1. Cost of electronics
2. Lack of cross-purpose software

- Due to Moores Law - No of transistors doubles every year, the need for ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) was not very preferred, since General Purpose IC could come up with double to transistor counts the next year. 
- Additionally, since leakage of IP can make or break the semiconductor industry, it has a very guarded research culture

`Being too early is the same as being wrong`

### Reasons why Charles Babbage's Machine Failed
Some things that were lacking in his time are 
- Stored Program
- Modifiable Code
- Memory
- Conditional Branching

### Drawback of CPU's for Deep Learning
- Good at executing any set of complex instructions but incur high memory costs because of the need to cache intermediate results and process one instruction at a time
	- This is known as Von Neumann bottleneck
- von Neumann bottleneck isn't useful for matrix multiplication

> Software isn't compatible with all hardware, since some hardware are more optimized to handle certain software stack over the other. Hence, there is a need to improve in this direction at some point
