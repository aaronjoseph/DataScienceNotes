- GCP Compute Engine is a computing and hosting service
- Allows you to create virtual machines
- IaaS - Infra as a service

## Preemptible Instances

- Much cheaper than compute engine instances
- But can be terminated at any time if Compute Engine needs the resources
- Can be terminated after running for 24 hours

> For making hardware modification on the Compute Engine, you will need to stop the VM 

- You can deploy Compute Engine VM using shell command as well
