Developed by Richard Feynman, who won the Nobel price in 1965 for quantum electrodynamics. This technique is useful for learning. 

The idea here is

- If you truly understand a specific topic, you should be able to explain the whole topic to a beginner. If you aren't able to, there are gaps in your knowledge

## Technique
1. Identify the topic/area of interest that you want to understand 
2. Use simple & clear explanation
3. Read your explanation from start to finish
	1. This helps you understand your full understanding
4. Find new sources
	1. This will help you differentiate between knowing and understanding
