> The Central Limit Theorem states that if you have a population with mean $\mu$  and standard deviation $\sigma$ and take sufficiently large random samples from the population , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed. This will hold true regardless of whether the source population is normal or skwed, provided the sample size is sufficiently large (usually n>30)

Here the parameters will be $\mu , \frac{\sigma^2}{n}$
