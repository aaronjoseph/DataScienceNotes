Database sharding is the process of making partition of data in a database or search engine, such that  the data is divided into various smaller distinct chunks or shards.

There are two types of sharding
1. Vertical Sharding - Here columns are broken
2. Horizontal Sharding - Here rows are broken

It improves the performance of your application, helps deal with scalability issues.
