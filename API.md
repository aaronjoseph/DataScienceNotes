API - `Application Programming Interface`refers to programming instructions and standards for accessing a web tool or database. An API can be packaged in [[SDK]]. 

- API is a computing interface which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow.
- Think of API as an online function

## Key Aspects of API

- Endpoint - Web URL where this could be accessed
- API Access Key - Key to access the API
- \*\*? Operator - To specify the parameters put into the API



## Difference between API & SDK

An API is a set of libraries that make up the core language that you can work with out of the box, whereas SDK is a development kit that facilitates usages of an API.

A software service’s implementation can be complex and changeable. If other software services had to be explicitly coded all that detail in order to use that service, the result would be brittle and error-prone. So instead, application developers structure the software they write so that it presents a clean, well-defined interface that abstracts away needless detail, and then they document that interface. That’s an Application Programming Interface.
