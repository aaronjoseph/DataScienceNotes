API - `Application Programming Interface`refers to programming instructions and standards for accessing a web tool or database. An API can be packaged in [[SDK]]. 

## Difference between API & SDK

An API is a set of libraries that make up the core language that you can work with out of the box, whereas SDK is a development kit that facilitates usages of an API.


A software service’s implementation can be complex and changeable. If other software services had to be explicitly coded all that detail in order to use that service, the result would be brittle and error-prone. So instead, application developers structure the software they write so that it presents a clean, well-defined interface that abstracts away needless detail, and then they document that interface. That’s an Application Programming Interface.
