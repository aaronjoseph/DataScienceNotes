Monte Carlo simulation where the idea is to run a simulator over and over again with randomized inputs and observe the aggregate results. It is a probability simulation technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainity in financial sectors, project management and other forecasting machine learning models.

For any future consideration, there is constant uncertainity, ambiguity and variability and therfore despite unprecedented access to information, future predictions are hard to make.
