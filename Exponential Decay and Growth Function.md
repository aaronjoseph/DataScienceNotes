# Exponenetial Growth Function

The formulae for exponential growth function is as below
$$y = A_0 e^{kt}$$ 

Here, e is the euler constant
k is the growth rate constant
t is the time difference

# Exponential Decay Function

The formulae for exponential growth function is as below
$$y = A_0 e^{-kt}$$ 

Here, e is the euler constant
k is the growth rate constant
t is the time difference
