**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** is a fundamental matrix factorisation technique in linear algebra that is widely used in data science, machine learning, and statistics. It decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, each with specific mathematical properties, and has various applications such as dimensionality reduction, noise filtering, and more.
