Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging) is a machine learning ensemble designed to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning algorithm.

It reduces variance and helps avoids overfitting. This is essentially a model averaging approach.

`Bootstrap Sampling`  - is a sampling technique wherein sampling is done with replacement. In essence, whenever there is restriction on the size of the data, there is a good chance of low variance
