Normal distribution is useful since it mimics many natural phenomena. 
It is also referred to as `Gausian Distribution`. The shape of the curve is like a bell and the extreme values at the tail not likely to occur

#### Formula of Normal distribution
General Formulae of PDF is 

$$f(x) = \frac{e^{\frac{-(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}$$

When $\mu$ and $\sigma$ is 0 and 1, then we have

$$f(x) = \frac{e^{\frac{x^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$$
