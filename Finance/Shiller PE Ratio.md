This is also called as CAPE - Cyclically Adjusted Price-to-Earnings Ratio. This is defined as Price divided by average of ten years of [[EPS|earnings per share]] (moving average), adjusted for inflation. 

$$Shiller Ratio = \frac{Price of Stock}{Earnings Per Share,Inflation Adjusted for 10 years}$$

> This ratio can be used to assess likely future returns from equities over timescales of 10 to 20 years -> `Higher CAPE values implies lower than average long-term annual average returns`
> The ratio is used to guage whether a stock is undervalued or overvalued by comparing its current market price to its inflation adjusted historical earnings record

### Criticisms

The CAPE ratio has been criticized in many ways as discussed below.

-   Most businesses are very different today than they were ten years ago or even five years ago. They also operate in different markets with different market conditions, different regulatory situations and in different countries. Retail for example, is entirely different than even five years ago.

-   Accounting today is different than ten years ago.

-   PE ratios are higher today in part because interest rates are on a 40 year secular downtrend. The reason for the downtrend in rates is more cash looking for a return than in the past (see #4 for reasons for this). Also, Central Banks have taken away a lot of the supply of fixed rate investments driving down interest rates. Lower rates lead to higher PE ratios.

-   The first rule of economics is price is a function of supply and demand. Demand for stocks has increased dramatically. There is much more cash looking for an investment. Over the past ten years the amount of money in mutual funds, hedge funds, ETFs, insurance companies, 401Ks and sovereign funds has surged. Meanwhile, supply has decreased. There are significantly fewer listed stocks in the U.S. than there were ten years ago.

-   The CAPE ratio does not adjust for changes in dividend yield which has been lowered in part by lower interest rates.

-   The CAPE ratio is used in part to determine when to position for reversion to the mean. However, the mean is changing. Also, if you waited for reversion to the mean, you would have entirely missed the last two expansions.
