Fixed Asset = Property, Plant & Equipments

**Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = Operating Revenues / Total Average Asset**

Here Average refers to the last two years.

Some important factors
- This factor should be considered with respect to the stage the company is in
	- A established company may not be using all its cash to invest in fixed assets, hence the ratio will be higher, not the case with growing company
	- Higher the ratio, `better it is`
