An Annual Report is filed at the end of financial year. 

Some of the sections of an Annual Report are


- `Management Statement` - This section goes through what the company management has to say about their business and the industry in general. All words mentioned in this section is quite vital to get a sense of what the company has in mind. 
	- The investor gets a perspective of how the man sitting right on top is thinking about his business. The content here is usually broad-based and gives a sense of how the business is positioned.
- `Management Discussion & Analysis (â€˜MD&A)` - This is one of the most important part of the Annual Report. The most standard way for any company to start this section is by talking about the macro trends in the economy. They discuss the overall economic activity of the country and the business sentiment across the corporate world. If the company has high exposure to exports, they even talk about global economic and business sentiment.

- `R&D Report`
- `Technology Report`

- `Financial Report` - This is generally the last part of the AR (Annual Report). It contains 3 parts to it
	- [[P&L Statement]]

### Consolidated and Standalone Financial Statements
- Financial statements come in two forms
	- Standalone Financial Statement/ Standalone Numbers
	- Consolidated Financial Statement/ Consolidated Numbers
- When companies have multiple subsidaries, then consolidated numbers make more sense
- However, when you want to have a viewpoint of the company without it's subsidaries profits, then standalone statement makes sense
