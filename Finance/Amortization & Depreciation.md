The cost of business assets can be expensed each year over the life of the asset. Amortization and depreciation are the two methods of calculating value for those buisness assets.

- Business will calculate such expense amounts in order to use them as a tax deduction and reduce their tax liability

## Amortization

Amortization is the practice of spreading an intangible asset's cover over that asset's useful life. Intangible assets include
- Patents and trademarks
- Franchise agreements
- Proprietary Procsses - Copyrights
- Cost of issuing bonds to raise capital
- Organizational Cost

## Depreciation

Depreciation is the expensing of a fixed asset over it's useful life or life expectancy. Depreciation represents how much of an assets value has been used up. Fixed assets are tangible assets, meaning they are physical assets that can be touched.

- Buildings
- Equipment
- Office furniture
- Vehicles
- Land
- Machinery

> `Depreciation` eats into company profits, and therefore must be looked carefully with respect to the gross profit. Higher the depreciation/Gross Margins is, higher the likelihood of higher debts and lower earnings
