In the free cash flow method, we inspect the money after accounting for all expenditures. 

**FCF = Cash from Operating Activities - Capital Expenditures**

The steps are as follows

1. Identify the Average Free Cash Flow of the company
2. Identify the growth rate
	1. Here, for smaller companies, assume 18% in the first 5 years into the future
	2. For larger companies, assuem 15% and 10% growth for the first 5 and the last 5 years
3. Estimate the future cash flows
	1. Table below shows a sample

Assume, it started with 100 Crs in Free Cash Flow

Type| Year | Growth Rate | Future Cash Flow (INR Crs)
---|---|---|---
First 5|2021 | 18% | 118
First 5|2022 | 18% | 139.24
First 5|2023 | 18% | 164.30
First 5|2024 | 18% | 193.87
First 5|2025 | 18% | 228.77
Last 5|2026 | 10% | 251.65
Last 5|2027 | 10% | 276.81
Last 5|2028 | 10% | 304.50
Last 5|2029 | 10% | 334.95
Last 5|2030 | 10% | 368.44

- Some of the key aspects when generating this table is be conservative with the growth numbers

## Terminal Value

`Terminal Growth Rate` is the rate at which the free cash flow grows beyond 10 years 

`Terminal Value` is the sum of all the future free cash flow beyond the 10th year, also called the **terminal year**. In simple words, how much the company makes post the 10th year mark to $\infty$

Formulae for Terminal Value

$$Terminal \ Value = \frac{FCF * (1 + Terminal \ Growth \ Rate)}{Discount \ Rate - Terminal \ Growth \ Rate}$$

Also,
- FCF here is the FCF at the 10th Year
- Terminal Growth Rate = 3.5% (Keep it low, < 5%)
- Discount Rate - 9%

Terminal Value = 368.44 *(1+0.035) / (0.09 - 0.035) = 6931.30 Crs

$\therefore$ The company's Net Free cashflow post the 10th year till infinity is Rs. 6931.30 Crores

## Net Present Value (NPV)

- Assumption, discount rate at 9 %

Type| Year | Growth Rate | Future Cash Flow (INR Crs) | Present Value
---|---|---|---| ---
First 5|2021 | 18% | 118 | 108.25
First 5|2022 | 18% | 139.24 | 117.19
First 5|2023 | 18% | 164.30 | 126.87
First 5|2024 | 18% | 193.87 | 137.34
First 5|2025 | 18% | 228.77 | 148.68
Last 5|2026 | 10% | 251.65 | 150.05
Last 5|2027 | 10% | 276.81 | 151.42
Last 5|2028 | 10% | 304.50 | 152.81 
Last 5|2029 | 10% | 334.95 | 154.22
Last 5|2030 | 10% | 368.44 | 155.63
| | | |  Net Present Value for Future Cash Flow on 6931.3 Cr | 2927.85

Sum of Present Value of cash flow = NPV of future free cash flows + PV of the terminal value = 2927.85 + 1402.51 = 4330.37 Crs

Which can be the assumed total free cash flow, all of which will belong to the investors of the said company

## Share Price Calculation

This is the last stage of the DCF Method.

- First we need to calculate the Net Debt
	- **Net Debt = Current Year Total Debt - Cash & Cash Balace**
- This needs to be added to the NPV of future cash flow
- Then the share price can be calculated as follows
	- **Share Price = (Total Present Value of Free Cash Flow - Net Debt)/Total Number of Shares**
- On the obtain Share Price, have a +/_ 10% band to account for inaccuracies, if the actual share price is below the 10% band, it is undervalued & above 10% band then overvalued
