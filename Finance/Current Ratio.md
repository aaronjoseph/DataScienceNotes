`Current Ratio/ Working Capital Ratio` is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It indicates how a company can maximize the current assets on its balace sheet to satisfy its current debt and other payables.

$$Current \ Ratio = \frac{Current \ Assets}{Current \ Liabilities}$$

## Note on Current Ratio

- Generally it is preferred to have Current Ratio of greater than 1
- However, some well performing companies have Current Ratio of less than 1
- The reason for this is as follows
	- Generous Dividends
	- Stock repurchases
- These two can cause the current assets to deplete
- However, strong companies can always tap into commercial papers to solve cash crunch
