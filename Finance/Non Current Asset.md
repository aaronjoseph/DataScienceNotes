 Non-current assets talk about the company’s assets, the economic benefit of which is enjoyed over a long period (beyond 365 days).
 
 **Fixed assets** are assets (both tangible and intangible) that the company owns, which cannot be converted to cash easily or which cannot be liquidated easily. Typical examples of fixed assets are land, plant and machinery, vehicles, building etc. Intangible assets are also considered fixed assets because they benefit companies over a long period of time.
 
 **Tangible Assets** consist of assets which have a physical form. In other words, these assets can be seen or touched. This usually includes plant and machinery, vehicles, buildings, fixtures etc.
 
 
 **Intangible assets** are assets which have an economic value but do not have a physical nature. This usually includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs etc.
 
 ## Calculating Assets
 
 All the assets should be depreciated over its useful life. Keeping this in perspective, when the company acquires an asset, it is called the ‘Gross Block’. Depreciation should be deducted from the Gross block, after which we can arrive at the ‘Net Block’.

**Net Block = Gross Block –Accumulated Depreciation**
