## Interest Coverage Ratio

This is also referred to as 
- Debt Service Coverage Ratio
- Debt Service Ratio

The interest coverage ratio helps us understand how much the company is earning relative to the interest burden of the company.

$$ Interest \ Coverage \ Ratio = \frac{Earnings \ before \ Interest \ and \ Tax}{Interest \ Payment}$$

Higher the Interest Coverage Ratio, better the ability of the company to service it's debt

EBIT = [[EBITDA Margin|EBITDA]] - [Depreciation & Amortization]

Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest Payment
