## Components of Shareholder Equity

## Equity

This comes under two types
- Preferred Stocks
- Common Stocks

	When company raises capital using either of the two, the company doesn't need to pay it back. It can do with as it pleases.
	
**Common Stocks**

Common stocks represents ownership in the company. Common stock owners are the owners of the company and have the right to elect a board of directors, which, in turn , will hire a CEO to run the company. Common stockholders receive dividends if the board directors votes to pay them. If the company is sold, the common stockholders get the loot.

**Preferred Stocks**

Preferred shareholders don't have voting rights. They have a right to a fixed or adjustable dividend that must be paid before the common stock owners receive a dividend. Prefered shareholders also have priority over common shareholders in the event that the company falls into bankruptcy.

**Additional Paid-in Capital**

Common stocks & Preferred Stocks are carried on the books at their par value. Any money in excess of par that was paid in when the company sold the stock will be carried on the books as "paid in capital"

## Retained Earnings

Retained earnings is an accumulated number, which means that each year, new retained earnings are added to the total of accumulated retained earnings from all prior years. Likewise, if the company loses money, the loss is subtractedfrom what the company has accumulated in the past.

`This is a critical line-item to assess the competitive advantage`

## Treasury Stock

Treasury stock, also known as treasury shares or reacquired stock refers to outstanding stock that is bought back from the shareholders by the issuing company. These shares are issued but no longer outstanding and are not included in the distribution of dividends or the calculation of [[Earnings Per Share]]
