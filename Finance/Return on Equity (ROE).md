**Return on Equity (RoE)**

The Return on Equity (RoE) is a critical ratio, as it helps the investor assess the return the shareholder earns for every unit of capital invested. RoE measures the entity’s ability to generate profits from the shareholder’s investments. In other words, RoE shows the efficiency of the company in terms of generating profits to its shareholders. Obviously, the higher the RoE, the better it is for the shareholders.

 **RoE = \[Net Profit / Shareholders Equity\]\* 100**
 
 ## Flaw of RoE
 
 The major flaw with RoE is that, with higher debt, the RoE can increase. A higher RoE with high cost of Debt is not optimal. This can be avoided using **DuPont Model/Dupont Identity**
 
 $$RoE = \frac{Net Profit}{Net Sale} * \frac{Net Sale}{Avg Total Asset}* \frac{Avg Total Asset}{Shareholder Equity}$$ 
 
 `The above equation is similar to the original equation` but is more detailed
