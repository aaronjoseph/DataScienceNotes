### Defination

The intrinsic value of any stock, bond or business today is determined by the cash inflows and outflows, discounted at an appropriate interest rate, that can be expected to occur during the remaining life of the asset.

The intrinsic value is the present value of all future cash flows, added together.

The things to know
1. How much cash will the business make in the future
2. What are the future cash flows worth to you right now?

### Process of Calculating Intrinsic Value Calculation

1. Calculating Owner's Earnings/ Free Cash Flow

	- Owner's Earnings = Operating Cash Flow - Maintenance Capital Expenditure

	`Operating Cash Flow` is also referred to as `Cash generated by operating activities`  - Is the amount of cash generated by a company's normal business operations.

	`Maintenance Capital Expenditure` - CapEx that is necessary for the company to continoue operating in its current form `[Most companies may not report this figure]`

	Alternatively, `Free Cash` Flow can be used which is defined as 
	- Free Cash Flow = Operating Cash Flow - Total Capital Expenditure	

2. Calculating the Free Cashflow 10 years into the future and applying Discounted Cashflow (15% )

	Year (Future) | Free Cash Flow | Discounted Cash Flow (15%)
	----|-----|-----
	1 | 100 | 85
	2 | 110 | 94
	3 | 121 | 103
	4 | 133|113
	5 | 146|124
	6 | 161|137
	7 | 177|151
	8 | 195|166
	9 |214 | 182
	10|236|200
	10x Val | 2360 | 2000

	The intrinsic value of the business is 2000 units as per the table above.

3. Margin of safety 
	`The function of margin of safety is, in essence, that of rendering unnecessary and acurate estimate of the future`
	
	`A margin of safety is necessary because valuation is an imprecise art, the future is unpredictable, and investors are human and do make mistakes`
	
	Margin of safety can be applied over the the intrisic value, while shaving away 30-50% of the intrinsic value.
	- 30% is applicable for a seasoned investor
	- 50% makes more sense for a new investor
