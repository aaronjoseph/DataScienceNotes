Balance Sheet gives information on assets, liabilities and shareholder equity `at a point in time`.

The Balance sheet has information that is prepared on flow basis, meaning, it has financial information about the company right from the time it was incorporated. `Balance sheet numbers are set for a specific date, it is more of a snapshot`

There are 3 sections to balance sheet
- [[Assets - Balance Sheet]]
- [[Liabilities - Balance Sheet]]
- [[Shareholder Equity]]

## Liability

Liability represents company obligation. Companies take up obligation because it believes these obligations will provide economic value in the long run.

**Total Liability = Shareholders’ Funds + Non Current Liabilities + Current Liabilities**

## Shareholder Equity / Owner's Equity

General Formulae **Equity = Asset - Liability**

Subtracting all your assets with Liabilities, we get shareholders equity. 

## Reserve and Surplus

Reserves - Is the money earmarked by the company for specific purposes
Surplus - Is where all the profits of the company reside

## Retained earnings 

Retained earnings refer to the portion of net income that a company retains and does not distribute to its shareholders as dividends. This accumulated sum is reinvested into the company, typically for business growth, debt reduction, or other operational needs. The retained earnings amount is updated each accounting period as follows:

1. **Beginning Retained Earnings**: This is the carryover amount of retained earnings from the end of the previous accounting period.
2. **Plus Net Income (or Minus Net Loss)**: The net income, which is the company's earnings after all expenses and taxes have been subtracted, is added to the beginning retained earnings. If the company incurred a loss, it is subtracted.
3. **Minus Dividends**: Any dividends paid out to shareholders are subtracted from this total.
4. **Equals Ending Retained Earnings**: The result is the ending retained earnings for the current period.

The formula can be summarized as:
$Ending Retained Earnings = Beginning Retained Earnings + Net Income - Dividends$

This amount is reported on the balance sheet under shareholders' equity and is a critical indicator of a company’s ability to fund its operations and growth internally.
