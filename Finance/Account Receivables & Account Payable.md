`Accounts receivable/ Net receivable` is the balance of money due to a firm for good or services delivered or used but not yet paid for by customers. Accounts receivables are listed on the balance sheet as [[Current Asset]]. Additionally, certain percentage of purchasers that were sold goods will not pay, an estimated amount for bad debts is deducted from the Receivables, which will give us `Net Receivables`

> Accounts receivable is an asset account on the balance sheet that represents money due to a company in the short-term.

> If a company has consistently lower percentage of Net Receivables to Gross Sales, relative to its competitors, it has a competitive advantage

`Accounts payable` is similar to accounts receivable, but instead of money to be received, itâ€™s money owed.
