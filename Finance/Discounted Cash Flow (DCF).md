## Time Value of Money (TMV)

> The time value of money is the concept that money you have now is worth more than the identical sum in the future due to its potential earning capacity. `TMV is the central concept underlying DCF`

`Future Value` : Is the estimation of the value of money that is present today in the future. For estimating the oppurtunity cost, we will need to account for compounding

`Present Value` : Is the estimation of current value of a future sum of money or stream of cash flow. For estimating the oppurtunity cost in today's term, we need to account for discounting

**Future Value = Amount * (1 + Opportunity Cost Rate)^ No of Years*
