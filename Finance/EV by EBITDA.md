  
EV/EBITDA  
  
## Why is it the most important ratio for commodity stock

Debt is one of the most important items to look at, for commodity stocks  
  
Debt has a significant impact on earnings during an upcycle - because of the tax shield on interest payments  
  
Moreover, as operating cash flows improve, debt falls, and EBITDA rises for the highly leveraged players  
  
The entire debt reduction amount flows to the equity side of the enterprise value equation  
  
Hence resulting in significant uptick in the market cap  
  
This also implies that the focus has to be more balance sheet driven, rather than P&L driven for commodity stocks
