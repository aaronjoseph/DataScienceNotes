A reserve bank of any country takes care of two primary objectives
- Maintain high employment rates
- Control Inflation/Deflation

When the economy is slowing, the central bank will do expansionary monetary policy
- This can be done by lowering interest rates
	- Lowered interest rates will increase customer spendings

Low interest rates have prevailed in most developed countries.

### Quantitative Easing / QE

This is the process of printing money into the economy. This money is injected using Open Market Operations, the central bank enters the market as a buyer, buying 
- Govt Bills & Bonds - This is purchased from banks

- This will increase money supply in the economy
- This will cause an increase the balance-sheet

The main objective of QE, is to lower the cost of borrowing
- This is induced by large amount of money that lies in the bank
	- This surplus cash comes in by the purchase of bonds or bills by reserve banks
- Since most of the banks end up having surplus cash, they tend to compete with other banks by lowering interest rates

This also reduces the cost of borrowing for the governments
- This will cause the investors to move their investments from Treasury funds to riskier assets such as Corporate Bond and Equity

QE could cause
- Hyper-inflation
- Injecting cash may not improve the economy - Japan is a prime example
