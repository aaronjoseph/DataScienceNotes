### Value Trap 
In value investing, one of the most important step is to identify stocks that are of real value investment

Value trap is a stock that appears to be cheaply priced in terms of [[PE Ratio|Price to Earnings Ratio]], Price to Cashflow (P/CF), Price to Book Value (P/B) for an extended period of time. This can inturn lead to a trap for a a investor, when the stock continues to langush or drop further.

When the stock is trading at a price lower than [[Intrinsic Value & Margin of Safety| intrinsic value]], it could turn out to be a value trap.   

### Factors to consider whether your investment is a value trap

1. Earnings and Cash Flow 

 If a stock's price is very cheap compared to past earnings this a warning sign. Past earnings have little effect on the future price of an investment. The markets are looking forward to discount future cash flows. If an investment has fallen to the point where it is absurdly cheap compared to past earnings, that is a clue something is deeply wrong.
 
 2. Business Plan

Beware of a business plan that is not understandable or is unprofitable. If a company is unable to make profits or has a plan that is complicated and hard to explain – avoid it.Bypass companies whose business plan has been outdated by new technologies.  If a product or service is outdated it doesn’t really matter how many other good attributes the company has; it will most likely fail. Technological obsolescence is a common misfortune of many business plans.

3. Management

Poor management can sink almost any company. If management is selling stock, giving guidance that is untrustworthy, or cutting the dividend; beware. These would be signs of a possible value trap.

Look for management that owns their company’s stock; insider buying is a positive sign. Quality management will give trustworthy guidance and demonstrate they have the knowledge to successfully guide the company.

4. Accounting

Producing complicated or fraudulent company accounting  reports often means there is additional hidden problems. Any hint of fraud should eliminate an investment from consideration for purchase. This usually results in further declines in the stock or bond price.

Real value investments will have transparent financial reports and credibility with investors. Quality companies with sound management will demonstrate openness and honesty with their successes and failures.

5. Balance Sheet / Debt

The balance sheet may be more important than the income statement for sorting out value traps. High debt can cause problems with liquidity and solvency that can sink an otherwise good business plan. A highly leveraged company has less leeway for making mistakes or overcoming obstacles.

A strong balance sheet is the foundation of a quality company and provides a margin of safety. When a company faces adverse conditions a conservative capital structure gives them the financial flexibility to meet the challenges.

6. Strategic Advantages

A company that lacks strategic advantages to overcome tough competition or heavy regulations can lose their ability to compete. In todays cutthroat global markets a company must have sustainable competitive advantage. Before purchasing a cheap stock be sure the company has competitive advantages that will provide the cash flow and growth needed to raise the price of the stock.

Does the company have the ability to stay ahead because they are a market leader, have economies of scale, pricing power, differentiation of product, cost benefits, or have powerful brands. Without one or more competitive advantages the company may not be able to thrive.

7. Look Forward Instead of Backwards

A stock may look cheap when compared to its past earnings. But the market values companies on future earnings and growth of those earnings.  What a company has earned in the past will have little to do with its value today.

Most financial sites quote P/E ratios based on past earnings.  Looking forward means estimating future earnings and cash flows; then comparing those metrics, not past metrics, to the current price.
