### Intrinsic Value
Intrinsic value is the perceived value of an investment's future cash flow, expected growth and risk. In other words, instrinsic value is the future cash flow discounted back to a present value. 

There are several ways to calculate the Intrinsic Value of a stock.

> The purpose of estimating the intrinsic value is to take advantage of mis-priced assets. If the market value is above the intrinsic value, there is no need to purchase and when the market value is below the intrinsic value, it's good to buy the asset

### Margin of Safety

`Margin of Safety` is the amount of discount (below the intrinsic value) a investor needs to account for before purchasing the asset. 

The margin of safety for an investment is the difference between the real or fundamental value and the price you pay. The goal of the value investor is to pay less than the real value.

### Relationship between Intrinsic Value 

Calculating the intrinsic value of bond is easier than stocks. Often time for stocks there are tangible and intangible factors to be considered and therefore the fluctuations are quite high. Hence when the variance or range of instrinsic value is quite high - it is a good idea to have a higher margin of safety.
