**The Operating Ratios** also called the ‘Activity Ratios’ measures the efficiency at which a business can convert its assets (both current and noncurrent) into revenues. This ratio helps us understand how efficient the management of the company is. For this reason, Operating Ratios are sometimes called the ‘Management Ratios’.

Some Operating Ratios are:

1.  [[Fixed Assets Turnover]]
2.  [[Working Capital Turnover]] 
3.  [[Total Assets Turnover]]
4.  [[Inventory Turnover]]
5.  [[Inventory Number of Days]]
6.  [[Accounts Receivable Turnover Ratio]]
7.  [[Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)]]
