Google created MapReduce. Google's challenge was to figure out how to index the exploding volume of content on the web. This was stored in [[Google File System]]. MapReduce is a form of data processing or programming paradigm. It also takes care of parallelism inherent in a distributed system.

In MapReduce, it breaks down into 2 steps
- `Map` - A step that can be performed in paralled
- `Reduce` - A step to combine the intermediate results
