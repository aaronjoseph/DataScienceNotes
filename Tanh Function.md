The hyperbolic tangent function, often referred to as the tanh function, is a rescaled version of the sigmoid function and is used as an activation function in neural networks. Here are its key features:

### Characteristics of the Tanh Function

- **Output Range**: The tanh function outputs values in the range of -1 to 1. This is its fundamental difference from the sigmoid function, which outputs values between 0 and 1.
  
- **Centered at Zero**: The tanh function is zero-centered, which means it outputs negative values for negative inputs and positive values for positive inputs. This can help with the convergence during training because it tends to produce mean activations closer to zero.

- **Saturation**: Similar to the sigmoid function, the tanh function also saturates at both ends of the output range. This means for inputs with large magnitudes, the function will approach -1 or 1, and the gradient will be close to zero.

- **Gradients**: The gradients of the tanh function vanish at both ends as well, which means it also suffers from the vanishing gradient problem. However, the gradients are stronger for values in the range between -1 and 1 compared to the sigmoid function.

- **Computation**: While tanh is computationally heavier than some other activation functions like ReLU, it is still widely used, especially in problems where having a zero-centered activation is beneficial.

### Formula and Derivative

The tanh function is mathematically represented as:

$$ \tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} $$

Its derivative, which is used in the backpropagation algorithm, is:

$$ \frac{d}{dx} \tanh(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x) $$

The derivative is also always positive and only vanishes as the input approaches positive or negative infinity.

### Application in Neural Networks

In neural networks, the tanh function can be used as the activation function for hidden layers. Given an input $h^{t-1}$, the output at layer $t$ would be $h^t = \tanh(h^{t-1})$.

When updating the weights, the chain rule is applied, incorporating the derivative of the tanh function:

$$ \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial h^t} \frac{\partial h^t}{\partial W} $$

### Vanishing Gradient Issue

Although tanh functions have stronger gradients than sigmoid functions (due to their range being between -1 and 1), they can still lead to vanishing gradients in deep networks with many layers. Since the gradients are strongest near the origin and decrease as the input values move away from zero, during backpropagation, compounded small gradients can diminish as they propagate back through the layers, causing the earlier layers to learn very slowly or not at all.


### Derivative of Tanh(x)

The hyperbolic tangent function, or \(\tanh(x)\), is commonly used as an activation function in neural networks. It is defined as:

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}
$$

To find the derivative of the \(\tanh\) function, denoted as \(\tanh'(x)\) or \(\frac{d}{dx}\tanh(x)\), we can use the quotient rule of calculus, which states that if we have a function \(f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}\), then its derivative is:

$$
f'(x) = \frac{g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)}{(h(x))^2}
$$

Applying this to the \(\tanh\) function:

Let \(g(x) = e^{x} - e^{-x}\) and \(h(x) = e^{x} + e^{-x}\), then:

$$
g'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(e^{x} - e^{-x}) = e^{x} + e^{-x}
$$

and

$$
h'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(e^{x} + e^{-x}) = e^{x} - e^{-x}
$$

Now, using the quotient rule:

$$
\tanh'(x) = \frac{(e^{x} + e^{-x})(e^{x} + e^{-x}) - (e^{x} - e^{-x})(e^{x} - e^{-x})}{(e^{x} + e^{-x})^2}
$$

Simplify the numerator:

$$
\tanh'(x) = \frac{(e^{2x} + 2 + e^{-2x}) - (e^{2x} - 2 + e^{-2x})}{(e^{x} + e^{-x})^2}
$$

After simplifying, we have:

$$
\tanh'(x) = \frac{4}{(e^{x} + e^{-x})^2}
$$

But we know that:

$$
\tanh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}}
$$

And therefore:

$$
1 - \tanh^2(x) = 1 - \left( \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{(e^{x} + e^{-x})^2}
$$

So, we get the final derivative of the \(\tanh\) function as:

$$
\tanh'(x) = 1 - \tanh^2(x)
$$

This result shows that the derivative of \(\tanh(x)\) can be expressed in terms of \(\tanh(x)\) itself, which is particularly useful in computations, especially when implementing backpropagation in neural networks.
