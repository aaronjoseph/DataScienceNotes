## Variance 
 The variance of X is the second central moment, i.e., the expected value of the squared difference between the RV X and its mean Âµ. In other words, $$Var(X) = E[(X-\mu)^2]$$

**Sample variance** is the variance calculated for the  sample

## Standard Deviation
Standard Deviation is the square root of Var(X)
