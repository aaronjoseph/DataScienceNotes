Deep Q-Learning is an advanced reinforcement learning technique that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks.

### Intuition
The idea behind Deep Q-Learning is to learn a parametrized Q-function from a dataset of experience tuples \((s, a, s', r)\), where:
- \(s\) represents the state,
- \(a\) the action taken,
- \(s'\) the resulting next state,
- \(r\) the reward received.

### Q-Learning with Linear Function Approximators
A traditional Q-Learning approach might use a linear function to approximate the Q-values:
$$ Q(s, a; w, b) = w^T_a s + b_a $$
Here, \(w\) and \(b\) are the parameters of the linear function for each action \(a\).

### Deep Q-Learning Framework
Deep Q-Learning extends this concept by fitting a deep neural network (referred to as a Q-Network) to predict Q-values:
$$ Q(s, a; \theta) $$
- \(\theta\): Parameters of the deep Q-Network.

Key advantages:
- **Practical Performance**: This approach has been shown to work well in practice, including on challenging problems.
- **RGB Image Input**: The Q-Network can process raw RGB images, allowing it to directly handle visual input from the environment.

### Training the Deep Q-Network
The training involves adjusting the parameters \(\theta\) of the Q-Network to minimize the loss between predicted and target Q-values. The target Q-values are typically computed using the Bellman equation and a separate target network to stabilize learning.

### Challenges and Considerations
- The algorithm usually involves a replay buffer to store experience tuples and sample from it to break the correlation between consecutive samples.
- Exploration vs. exploitation is a key challenge, requiring a strategy to balance learning new behaviours and exploiting known ones.
- Regularly updating the target network parameters with the main Q-Network parameters is crucial to keep training stable.

Deep Q-Learning represents a significant step forward in allowing agents to learn policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs like images

## Exploration Problem in Deep Q-Learning

### Greedy Policies
A greedy policy, which always selects the action with the highest Q-value, is expressed as:

$$
\pi_{\text{gather}} = \arg\max_a Q(s, a; \theta)
$$

However, consistently selecting the action with the maximum estimated Q-value can lead to local minimas and a lack of exploration. The agent may get stuck with suboptimal actions if it never explores alternative actions that could potentially lead to higher rewards.

### Addressing Exploration
To address the need for exploration, strategies like $\epsilon$-greedy are employed. In an $\epsilon$-greedy strategy, the agent chooses a random action with a probability of $\epsilon$, and the greedy action (the one with the maximum Q-value) with a probability of $1 - \epsilon$. This approach balances the act of exploiting known information to take actions that seem best and exploring the environment to discover potentially better options.

This exploration strategy is crucial for ensuring that the policy does not prematurely converge to suboptimal solutions and instead continues to learn better strategies by trying out different actions.
