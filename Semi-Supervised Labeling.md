Semi-Supervised Labeling requires two types of data
- Human Labelled data
- Unlabelled data
	- Unlabelled data is cheap to procure than Human Labelled data
	- Unlabelled data will be labelled by using human labelled data by utilising ML models. 

## Lable Propogation

- Semi-Supervised ML Algorithm
- Labels are propogated to the unlabelled points
	- Based on similarity or "community structure"
- **Graph based techniques**
	- Unlabeled examples can be assigned labels based on their neighbours
