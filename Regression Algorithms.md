[[Classification Algorithms]]

>`Regression` is a way to extrapolate your dataset to predict values on the basis of independent variables. Regression is an important problem in its own right

### RandomForestRegressor
This makes use of random forest to generate the regression line

### DecisionTressRegressor
This makes use of decision tree to make the regression line

### SVM
SVM can be used for regression

### Linear Regression ![[Regression_Derivation.pdf]]

Is the most basic algorithm, of all some of the basic principles of Linear regression are
1. Linear Relation between independent variable and dependent variable
2. Less or no multicollinearity
3. No auto-correlation
4. Homoscedasticity

```py
from sklearn.linear_models import LinearRegression
```

### Logistic Regression


### Ridge Regression

Ridge regression is used to analyze multiple regression lines that suffer from multicollinearity. Ridge regression is a method that seeks to reduce the MSE by adding some bias at the same time reducing variance

### Lasso Regression
