A random variable is one that can take multiple values depending on the outcome of a random event. The possible outcomes are the possible values taken by the variable.

If the outcome is finite, it is said to be `discrete` (Like the number on the die) and if it isn't finite then it is said to be `continuous` - decimal number between 0 & 1

>`Random Variable` is a variable whose numerical outcome is that of a random phenomenon. There are two types of radom variables - Discrete [1,2,3,...] and continous [1.1,1.2,...] random variable
