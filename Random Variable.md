A random variable is one that can take multiple values depending on the outcome of a random event. The possible outcomes are the possible values taken by the variable.

If the outcome is finite, it is said to be `discrete` (Like the number on the die) and if it isn't finite then it is said to be `continuous` - decimal number between 0 & 1
