> `Best Fit line`  in linear regression is the one which tries to minimize the residual sum of squares. It is the line which is supposed to give the best predictions on the unseen data depending on the training data on which it is built.

**Principles of Linear Regression**

1. **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent variable (_x_) and the dependent variable (_y_) is linear
2. **Independence**: The residuals (errors) are independent, meaning there is no correlation between consecutive residuals, especially in time series data. [[Collinearity]]
3. **Homoscedasticity**: The residuals exhibit constant variance across all levels of the independent variable (_x_)
4. **Normality**: The residuals of the model are normally distributed
