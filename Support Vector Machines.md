[[Classification Algorithms]]

SVM or Support Vector Machine is used for linear, non-linear classification, regression and outlier detection.

- SVM's are sensitive to the scale of the features and therefore it is important to do feature scaling before training the SVM algorithm

Nonlinear SVM Classifier
- Nonlinear SVM classifier can be acheived by using PolynomialFeatures library of Sklearn
