- Network Architecture Search (NAS) is used for automating the design of artificial neural networks
- It helps find the optimal architecture


### Neural Architecture Search 
- Search Space
	- Herein, the space of architecture is defined
	- Human bias may creep in, if certain architectures are excluded
	- There are two approaches to it
		- `Macro`
		- `Micro`
- Search Strategy
	- This is all about how to explore the search space 
	- There is always a risk of premature convergence
- Performance Estimation Strategy
	- Provides the model performace back to the search strategy with a feedback loop
