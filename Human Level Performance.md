Human Level Performance in ML is relevant when we need to establish the baseline. 
This can be useful if we need to estimate the Bayes error/ irreducible error to help with error analysis and prioritization.

- Improving [[Data - MLOPs | Label Consistency]] is one way of improving HLP.
- Additionally, ambiguous labeling instructions can cause HLP to fall down
