Approach - V

I have total experience of 3.5 Years of which I have spent more than 2.5 years in fin-tech and the rest in consultancy. Currently I work for Kaleidofin which is a Series-A fin-tech start-up that is working towards bringing financial inclusion to the underbanked segement.

The major project that I have undertaken is Mutual Fund Analytics which is a DS tooling project - and I worked on this as a IC. This project saved the company close to 500+ ruppees in annual subscriptions cost and over 300+ ruppees in AWS cloud charges. This tool was used to portfolio management on both the customer and company side. 

Additonally I have taken care of Dashboarding, wherein some of the key dashboards I have integrated ML using AWS Sagemaker and deployed over tools such as AWS Quicksight.  On the dashboarding front I have experience in Tableau, AWS Quicksight and GCP Datastudio. 

Also, I have taken care of data engineering as well wherein I have taken care of DBA tasks such as indexing database for better performance. Designing the schema such that the new database is normalized. And writing code in Apache Airflow which is a workflow orchestration tool.

Apart from the diverse deliverables that I have taken care of, I have also handled slides for board meetings, provided financial information to Investment bank for fund-raising reasons. Had the oppurtunity to work with World Bank in providing relevant information about our customers and forbes magazine when we working on getting our story out

Backward Story - IV

I am Aaron Joseph, currently working as a Data Scientist at Kaleidofin which is a fin-tech series-A startup & I have 3+ years of experience in Data Science. My core expertise lies in Model Development, Deployment & App creation. Additionally, I have taken care of Data Warehousing and dashboarding and love evangelizing data science solution to business stakeholders since I strongly belive buy-in from management is a strong indicator on whether the project will succeed or not.

Now with respect to my tech expertise 

- I have used libraries such as `Tensorflow, Sklearn, Scipy, XGboost and other ML libraries`.
- Also have worked with `AWS Quicksight, GCP Data Studio & Tableau` which are dashboarding tools
- I have used Apache Airflow for Data warehousing
- Also have good knowledege of Git for version controling and Docker for containerisation

At my current org, I work in multiple projects ranging from Fund Analytics,  Simulation & Dashboarding wherein I take care of both Data Engineering and Dashboards requirements as a whole - also I have created ML Dashboards wherein the models were developed over AWS sagemaker and projected over AWS Quicksight.

One of the major project that I have undertaken, is Mutual Fund Analytics,wherin I was with finding low-volatility and high return financial instruments. I worked on this as an Individual contributor and developed a end-to-end tool wherein I did Data Ingesting using APIs, Data Cleaning, Data warehousing, Model Development , Dashboarding  & App Development using Streamlit and Docker. My contribution to this project resulted in a codebase of over 8000+ line and a fully functional financial dashboard that monitors the returns of our underbanked customers. Also, I had to build functional skills on the way so as to aid the Fund committe to make the final fund-selection decision.

I have also done internship hiring for the data science team where-in I contributed in developing the question bank and handled the intial stages of interviews - at its very peak I did over 25 interviews in a day.

Apart from the diverse deliverables that I have take care of, I have worked on Developing the board slides for the management on multiple occasions, liasioned with Investment Banks - Investus capital for the purpose of providing relevant information for fund raising purposes. I have also had the oppurtunity to work with World Bank in providing critical inputs for their better understanding. And more importantly I have done a lot documentation.

Backward Story - `Always find a way to see the Backwards Story - Find a way to pull some aspects from the Job Description`

I have an experience of over 3+ Years,  and I currently work with Kaleidofin, which is a Series-A startup working in the underbanked space. I joined when it was in seed stage. At Kaleidofin, I got the chance to work with multiple teams, Sales, Solutions & Operations and I also worked on end-to-end projects as an IC. Most of the projects I worked on involved me to get an better understanding of the underlying requirements to development of data pipelines to development of dashboards, involving complex calculations and at the same time I have developed analytical solution based of the data warehouse I developed. Which I have deployed over some of the latest framework Streamlit & Dash. I have worked very closely with the management level for various requirements and I developed a knack of building good rapport for various requirements that they need from time to time. In all I have experience in Data Warehousing using Airflow framework. I have a good understanding of the version control systems namely Git. In python, I have worked with TensorFlow, SCipy, Sklearn which are the libraries for Machine Learning and I have good understanding of MatplotLib, Seaborn and Plotly. Infact my recent interest in Plotly animation charts inspired me to get some company related visuals to the company Web-App, hosted internally. I also have good knowledge of Docker  and have deployed analytical solution over docker.

In all over the 3 years, I have worked in Consultancy & Finance and have worked with multiple teams across my career.

Forward Story

I have been fascinated by the space of machine learning from my college days, infact I was so interested that I did a certification in Machine Learning By Andrew Ng and being from an electronics background my project was on Image classification using Docker which I deployed on GCP over Nvidia K8 GPU. My early career was with MuSigma and I was quite fortunate to learn the skills required in the industry. My interest in Mutual Funds got me to FundsIndia which is one of the largest mutual fund distributor in India. Here, I was blown away by the learning I got from the reseach team which focused on finding the relevant funds for our customers. Though I worked with Product, Strategy and Marketing team, I was always intrigued by their methodology. At FundsIndia I learnt about the functioning of Product and Marketing team - I developed a broad understanding of how UI/UX team understand customer needs and how Marketing team work constantly on SEO and paid marketing to beat the competition. Shortly after I completed a year at FundsIndia my ex-boss told me about an oppurtunity at his current startup wherein there was a spot for MutualFundAnalytics - this oppurtunity got me interested for 2 reasons, 1, I could work on the algorithm to discover Mutual Funds and secondly because this startup worked towards empowering the lives of the poor in India who have no access to the basic financial services that we have access to - complete opposite to what I was exposed to FundsIndia which taped into significantly richer customers. It was because of the second reason I took a one-way ticket to Chennai to work with them and empower the life of the poor and needy. My journey at Kaleidofin has been kind of a rollercoaster, wherein not only did I work on Mutual Fund Analytics, where ironically had to double down on learning the nuances of Mutual Fund Industry, I was responsible for dashboarding, development of boiler-plate codes within the team such as SMTP and connector codes & worked on data warehousing as well.  I also have experience in Data Modelling - in Churn Analysis and Forecasting. And I have also handled hiring of interns end-to-end for the startup.
