### Format I 

`Start Section`
- As some of you may already know, the firm and I have parted ways.
- It is with heavy heart that I annouce my last day at company will be `date`
- I have had to make a difficult decision to end my time at company, my last date will be `this`

`Reason Part`

I will be moving back to Bangalore to be closer to my family. Family means everything to me and it's time for me to come back after my time at Chennai.

`Gratitude Section`

- I will foundly look back on the ` Length` odd years that I spent here. I would describe the `Company` culture to be internally cooperative to be as externally competitive as possible. It is by this virture of this internal cooperation that I benefited the most during my time here. Thus, a big heartfelt thank you for the teachings, memories and experiences - all very valuable to my life resume. While I may not have always met expectation, I would certainly like to think that I gave my very best, approached task with the best of my abilities.
- I feel lucky to have had to oppurtunity to work with who I consider to be some of the most talented and genuine individuals that I have come across in my career. I am proud of the work we accomplished together, and I am a better professional because of it

I may have learnt the odd technical finance concept or two; however the more valuable lessons, at least in my perspective that will indelibly stick with me stem from being grittier and more resilient, learning to take calculated risks, dealing with colourful personalities and understanding what makes them tick, becoming comfortable in being uncomfortable, and finding a way and doing whatever it takes to get the task done.

I don't know what the future holds for me, however, I am filled with nervous-excitement at the prospect of what might be in store for me, I have never imagined working in finance, let alone `Whatever cool work you did`.  I would devote the near future to family, reading, writing, kaggle and day-dreaming.

I plan on being in the city for atleast a few weeks, but my gut tells me to eventually move back to my old stomping grounds in BLR . I have spent close to a year in chennai, and have truly come to belive that the days are long but the years are short. I take enough confidence and self-belief with me from my time here at `company` that I can add value to whatever it is that I end up pursuing "Full-Time" .

`Project Handover` 

- I will be handing over my projects to so and so person, please contact them for the same

I wish you the very best in all your future personal and professional endeavours. My phone number and personal email address are () . If you ever happen to visit Bangalore, especially North Bangalore, I will love to meet you at a coffee shop for a good catch-up chat!
