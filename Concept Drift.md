> In concept drift we have to correct the target data `y`

When the statistical properties of the model output [target value] changes over time.

In some data analysis applications, data evolve over time and must be analyzed in real time. In essense concept drift occurs when the patterns the model learned no longer hold.

Examples
-   **Competitors launch new products.** Consumers have more choices, and their behavior changes. As should sales forecasting models.
-   **Macroeconomic conditions evolve.** As some borrowers default on their loans, the credit risk is redefined. Scoring models need to learn it.
-   **Mechanical wear of equipment.** Under the same process parameters, the patterns are now slightly different. It affects quality prediction models in manufacturing.
