Topic modeling is a branch of unsupervised natural language processing which is used to represent a text document with the help of several topics, that can best explain the underlying information in a particular document. This can be thought in terms of clustering, but with a difference. Now, instead of numerical features, we have a collection of words that we want to group together in such a way that each group represents a topic in a document.

### Need for Topic Modeling

Topic modeling provides methods for automatically organizing, understanding, searching and summarizing large electronic archives.
- Discovering hidden themes in the collection
- Classifying the documents into the discovered themes
- Using the classification to organize/summarize/search the documents

### Model Examples

- [[Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA|LDA]] - Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- NNMF - Non Negative Matrix Factorization
- LSA - Latent Semantic Analysis
